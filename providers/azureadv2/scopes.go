// OpenID Permissions
//
// You can use these permissions to specify artifacts that you want returned in Azure AD authorization and token
// requests. They are supported differently by the Azure AD v1.0 and v2.0 endpoints.
//
// With the Azure AD (v1.0) endpoint, only the openid permission is used. You specify it in the scope parameter in an
// authorization request to return an ID token when you use the OpenID Connect protocol to sign in a user to your app.
// For more information, see Authorize access to web applications using OpenID Connect and Azure Active Directory. To
// successfully return an ID token, you must also make sure that the User.Read permission is configured when you
// register your app.
//
// With the Azure AD v2.0 endpoint, you specify the offline_access permission in the scope parameter to explicitly
// request a refresh token when using the OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect protocols. With OpenID Connect, you specify the
// openid permission to request an ID token. You can also specify the email permission, profile permission, or both to
// return additional claims in the ID token. You do not need to specify User.Read to return an ID token with the v2.0
// endpoint. For more information, see OpenID Connect scopes.
const (
	// OpenIDScope shows on the work account consent page as the "Sign you in" permission, and on the personal Microsoft
	// account consent page as the "View your profile and connect to apps and services using your Microsoft account"
	// permission. With this permission, an app can receive a unique identifier for the user in the form of the sub
	// claim. It also gives the app access to the UserInfo endpoint. The openid scope can be used at the v2.0 token
	// endpoint to acquire ID tokens, which can be used to secure HTTP calls between different components of an app.
	OpenIDScope ScopeType = "openid"

	// EmailScope can be used with the openid scope and any others. It gives the app access to the user's primary
	// email address in the form of the email claim. The email claim is included in a token only if an email address is
	// associated with the user account, which is not always the case. If it uses the email scope, your app should be
	// prepared to handle a case in which the email claim does not exist in the token.
	EmailScope ScopeType = "email"

	// ProfileScope can be used with the openid scope and any others. It gives the app access to a substantial
	// amount of information about the user. The information it can access includes, but is not limited to, the user's
	// given name, surname, preferred username, and object ID. For a complete list of the profile claims available in
	// the id_tokens parameter for a specific user, see the v2.0 tokens reference:
	// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-id-and-access-tokens.

	// OfflineAccessScope gives your app access to resources on behalf of the user for an extended time. On the work
	// account consent page, this scope appears as the "Access your data anytime" permission. On the personal Microsoft
	// account consent page, it appears as the "Access your info anytime" permission. When a user approves the
	// offline_access scope, your app can receive refresh tokens from the v2.0 token endpoint. Refresh tokens are
	// long-lived. Your app can get new access tokens as older ones expire.
	//
	// If your app does not request the offline_access scope, it won't receive refresh tokens. This means that when you
	// redeem an authorization code in the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow, you'll receive only an access token from
	// the /token endpoint. The access token is valid for a short time. The access token usually expires in one hour.
	// At that point, your app needs to redirect the user back to the /authorize endpoint to get a new authorization
	// code. During this redirect, depending on the type of app, the user might need to enter their credentials again
	// or consent again to permissions.

//	mobilePhone

//	pastProjects

// have either User.Read.All (read only) or User.ReadWrite.All.

// This is because the full profile might contain sensitive directory information. The basic profile includes only the
// following properties:
//
//	displayName
//	givenName
//	mail
//	photo
//	surname
//	userPrincipalName

// permissions to read those resources too, or Microsoft Graph will return an error. This means the app will also need
// Directory permissions, and, for delegated permissions, the signed-in user will also need sufficient privileges in the
// organization to access directory roles and administrative units.
