# Goth: Multi-Provider Authentication for Go [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/markbates/goth?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/markbates/goth) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markbates/goth.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/markbates/goth) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/markbates/goth)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/markbates/goth)

Package goth provides a simple, clean, and idiomatic way to write authentication
packages for Go web applications.

Unlike other similar packages, Goth, lets you write OAuth, OAuth2, or any other
protocol providers, as long as they implement the `Provider` and `Session` interfaces.

This package was inspired by [https://github.com/intridea/omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth).

## Examples

See the [examples](examples) folder for a working application that lets users authenticate
through Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus etc.

To run the example either clone the source from GitHub

```text
$ git clone git@github.com:markbates/goth.git
```
or use
```text
$ go get github.com/markbates/goth
```
```text
$ cd goth/examples
$ go get -v
$ go build
$ ./examples
```

Now open up your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the example.

To actually use the different providers, please make sure you set environment variables. Example given in the examples/main.go file

## Security Notes

By default, gothic uses a `CookieStore` from the `gorilla/sessions` package to store session data.

As configured, this default store (`gothic.Store`) will generate cookies with `Options`:

```go
&Options{
   Path:   "/",
   Domain: "",
   MaxAge: 86400 * 30,
   HttpOnly: true,
   Secure: false,
 }
```

To tailor these fields for your application, you can override the `gothic.Store` variable at startup.

The following snippet shows one way to do this:

```go
key := ""             // Replace with your SESSION_SECRET or similar
maxAge := 86400 * 30  // 30 days
isProd := false       // Set to true when serving over https

store := sessions.NewCookieStore([]byte(key))
store.MaxAge(maxAge)
store.Options.Path = "/"
store.Options.HttpOnly = true   // HttpOnly should always be enabled
store.Options.Secure = isProd

gothic.Store = store
```
