# Goth: Multi-Provider Authentication for Go [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/markbates/goth.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/markbates/goth)

Package goth provides a simple, clean, and idiomatic way to write authentication
packages for Go web applications.

Unlike other similar packages, Goth, lets you write OAuth, OAuth2, or any other
protocol providers, as long as they implement the `Provider` and `Session` interfaces.

This package was inspired by [https://github.com/intridea/omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth).
